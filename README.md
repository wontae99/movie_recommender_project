# movie_recommender_project by using flask, flask_bootstrap, flask_sqlalchemy, wtforms, https://www.themoviedb.org/ api

so far I've done :
1. made a simple site design that recommends movies I watched (contains title, release date, rate, tagline, description of movies)
2. made each movie into card style - poster and rank num on front / title, release date, tagline, description on back (flip when hover)
3. I can change movie rating, tagline with 'Update' button
4. also can delete a movie card with 'Delete' button
5. when click 'Add Movie', site loads search form
6. when fill out the search form and submit, search the movie with movie api and get a list of movies that includes input words
7. after select a movie in the list, make a new card of selected movie.
8. with sqlalchemy added movies stored in database.
